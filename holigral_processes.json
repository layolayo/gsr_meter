            "text": "Denying: An ego defence mechanism that operates unconsciously to resolve emotional conflict, and to reduce anxiety by refusing to perceive the more unpleasant aspects of external reality;  Denying fact: This form of denial is where someone avoids a fact by lying. This lying can take the form of an outright falsehood (commission), leaving out certain details in order to tailor a story (omission), or by falsely agreeing to something (assent, also referred to as 'yes-ing' behaviour). Someone who is in denial of fact is typically using lies in order to avoid facts that they think may be potentially painful to themselves or others.  Denying responsibility: This form of denial involves avoiding personal responsibility by blaming, minimizing or justifying. Blaming is a direct statement shifting culpability and may overlap with denial of fact. Minimizing is an attempt to make the effects or results of an action appear to be less harmful than they may actually be. Justifying is when someone takes a choice and attempts to make that choice look okay due to their perception of what is 'right' in a situation. Someone using denial of responsibility is usually attempting to avoid potential harm or pain by shifting attention away from themselves.  Denying impact: Denial of impact involves a person avoiding thinking about or understanding the harms their behaviour have caused to themselves or others. By doing this, that person is able to avoid feeling a sense of guilt and it can prevent that person from developing remorse or empathy for others. Denial of impact reduces or eliminates a sense of pain or harm from poor decisions.  Denying awareness: This type of denial is best discussed by looking at the concept of state dependent learning. People using this type of denial will avoid pain and harm by stating they were in a different state of awareness (such as alcohol or drug intoxication or on occasion mental health related). This type of denial often overlaps with denial of responsibility.  Denying cycle: Many who use this type of denial will say things such as, 'it just happened.' Denial of cycle is where a person avoids looking at their decisions leading up to an event or does not consider their pattern of decision making and how harmful behaviour is repeated. The pain and harm being avoided by this type of denial is more of the effort needed to change the focus from a singular event to looking at preceding events. It can also serve as a way to blame or justify behaviour (see above).  Denying denying: This can be a difficult concept for many people to identify in themselves, but is a major barrier to changing hurtful behaviours. Denial of denial involves thoughts, actions and behaviours which bolster confidence that nothing needs to be changed in ones personal behaviour. This form of denial typically overlaps with all of the other forms of denial, but involves more self-delusion.  How many different things might a person deny? (e.g. responsibility, consequences, blame, truth?)"

Intellectualization is often accomplished through rationalization; rather than accepting reality, one may explain it away to remove one's self.  For example, suppose Jay has been brought up by a strict father, and he feels hurt and angry as a result. Although Jay may have deep feelings of hatred towards his father, when he talks about his childhood, Jay may say: 'Yes, my father was a rather firm person, I suppose I do feel some antipathy towards him even now.'  Jay intellectualizes; he chooses rational and emotionally cool words to describe experiences which are usually emotional and very painful  How many different ways could you intellectualise?"

They have been developed after years of thought and meditation as to the best practices to enable harmony.  Every rule has its exception - and so do these principles.   1. Cause no harm; this is just good karma for your next life, and so on.  Or cause harm and experience the consequences.  2. Clean up after yourself; this is the only serious rule.  The consequences are anti-social, and I call upon the neighbours and relevant powers to visit the karmic return.  3. Be not serious, except for the purpose of entertaining the non-serious.  Laughter is the natural response to truth.  It is also fine to be serious if you really insist.  4. Know you are perfect as you are, as is everyone else, for they are you.  So whatever you do to them, you only do to yourself, and you WILL be on the receiving end during that life when you are that other person.  This is why harmlessness pays, and good enough reason to be harmless and grateful for other people\u2019s acts of harmlessness.  It is also fine to not be harmless and not to be perfect - there are many times and places where this serves.  5. When asked, you may accept or decline as you wish (yes to the soul, no to manipulation: use discernment).  It is also fine to not use discernment and explore the consequences.  6. Be helping to change something only when asked by someone else, because everything is already perfect. If you wish to change something, work with it; help it to do its job, and it will cease as naturally and effortlessly as possible.  It is also fine to offer to help, and to help without being asked - just don\u2019t expect to have your help accepted - nor to receive any gratitude.  7. Be unattached to your offers being accepted.  \u201cShall I put the light on or not?\u201d  \u201cWould you like a cup of tea?\u201d  It is okay to offer a service, but do so without attached desire, remain equanimous to the response.  It is also fine to be attached - enjoy it.  8. Never be telling anyone how to do their job or activity - unless they asked you first - else you might ruin their learning or incur their wrath.  Every single job or human activity is done by the actor for the purpose of learning about or understanding that activity; they learn by doing.  It is also fine to tell someone - enjoy the consequences.  9. Be neither judging of yourself nor of others.  There is no right or wrong; each actor has attracted the others, and the outcome perfect for all - at the soul level of perception - obviously the personality might not agree.  Paradoxically, therefore, it is fine to be judging if so required by the other actors.10. Be accepting of others as they are, and of yourself as you are; its the only way to assure inner and outer peace, but you can choose who you spend time with - you do not have to consort with anyone.  It is also fine to be non-accepting - enjoy a bit of judgement. 11. Release yourself and others from your interpretations of your perceptions.  You can only see yourself in others.  It is an act of harm to hold even an interpreted perception of another being unless it has been requested.  Notice maybe, but let it pass.  It is also fine to not release - hold on and experience it. 12. Be in the here and now.  When mind arises, let it do its job and return to peace.  Let emotions inform right action and flow out to completion.  It\u2019s also fine to be other than in the here and now - dream of the future and re-think the past. 13. Listen as follows: when a person says \u201cI\u201d without contrivance they are speaking for you - take note; and when a person says \u201cyou\u201d, do not listen - for they are projecting.  The same goes for you: listen when you say \u201cyou\u201d to another person - this is your projection.  This guideline must NOT become manipulated.  Never substitute your natural pronouns usage - own any desire to do so and own any mis-uses and clean them up with the processes, please. 14. Defend the weak against the powerful.  Assume the powerful are corrupt and the weak innocent - until proven otherwise.  Help the weak to help themselves.  It is also fine not to follow the way.  But there are consequences.  For an easy life, follow the way; for more challenge, do not.  This code is what delegates may expect of our facilitators, but we do not expect delegates to follow this code.  Choose an aspect to consider."

Offer this peace to others, and credit the source.   2. Cause no harm 2a. see the 42 aspects of the code of Ma'At for examples - below. 2b. to others or to yourself - and especially do not justify the causing of harm.   3. Clean up after yourself 3a. also see the code of Ma\u2019At for what this means (do not pollute the land or the water or the air, do not litter, ...) 3b. This means businesses, governments, armies, people, services and so on.   4. The poor are assumed innocent and the powerful assumed corrupt; 4a. the burden of proof is always on the more powerful party; 4b. if one party is not significantly more powerful then both are saddled with the burden of proof.   5. Co-operate in partnerships and heterarchies 5a. leaders are stewards, who recognise they are the least worthy, in service to their people 5b. buy from a partnership in preference to a company 5c. charging interest is immoral   6. Do not worship the gods, nor beg them for forgiveness; thank them instead 6a. instead: make amends to injured parties, and/or to people who have suffered such abuses as you have perpetrated. 6b. walk your talk; the gods will judge your actions not your words and forgive AFTER atonement. 6c. pray altruistically to them for the betterment of the world - for others; pray not for yourself.   7. No more victim: you are responsible, you have a conscience: use it. 7a. notice your excuses, complaints, rationalisations, justifications, arguments and giving-away of power to others: and stop doing these things. 7b. and no more persecuting; make amends and stop.   8. We are all one, part of the ALL; both individual and collective. 8a. The world is now a multiplicity, not a duality; forget good and evil. 8b. Every being has a unique role; value it.   9. Honour your word.  Speak the truth.  If you are unsure, do not commit; once you do say \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019, follow it through. 9a. Minimise assumptions about others, and about what others say to/about you - take nothing personally. 9b. Publish and follow your code.  Live your life by it.  Choose one of these"
