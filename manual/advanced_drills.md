# Advanced Training Drills

These drills focus on complex meter interpretation, including finding hidden dates and assessing lists for the best read.

## Drill 9: Assessment by Instant Read
**Purpose**: To locate the correct item on a list by observing the exact instant of the read.

**Reference**: See **[Assessment Word Lists](manual/assessment_lists.md)** for practice material.

**Steps**:
1.  **Preparation**: Have the Coach select one item from a list mentally (e.g., "Oak" from List 2) but keep it secret.
2.  **Assessment**: Read the list items aloud to the Coach, one by one.
    *   *Pace*: "Ash..." (pause), "Beech..." (pause).
3.  **Observation**: Watch for an **Instant Read** (Tick or Fall) that occurs *exactly* when you speak the word.
4.  **Selection**: Mark the item that produced the read.
5.  **Check**: Ask the Coach if you were correct.

> "The read must occur precisely at the end of the question or syllable."

## Drill 10: Precision Reading
**Purpose**: To pinpoint the *exact* syllable where a reaction begins.

**Reference**: See [Assessment Word Lists](manual/assessment_lists.md) (List 6) for practice sentences.

**Steps**:
1.  **Read**: Read a long sentence or a list item to the subject.
2.  **Spot**: Watch the graph intently.
3.  **Query**: Immediately after the read, ask yourself: *"On what word was that read?"*
4.  **Verify**: Was it on the *beginning* of the word, or the *end*?
    *   *Goal*: To differentiate "Instant" reads from "Latent" (delayed) reads.
    *   *Standard*: A valid read must happen **instantly** (speed of thought). If it is late, it is not that item.

## Drill 11: Finding a Hidden Date
**Purpose**: To train the user to locate a specific date using the "Bracketing" method.

**Steps**:
1.  **Selection**: The Coach selects a specific date (e.g., July 4, 1995).
2.  **Bracketing (Years)**: The User asks questions to narrow down the range.
    *   "Is the date before 2000?" -> **Read** (Yes).
    *   "Is the date before 1990?" -> **No Read** (No).
    *   "Is it between 1990 and 1995?" -> **Read** (Yes).
3.  **Pinpointing**: Once the year is found, move to Months, then Days.
4.  **Result**: The meter confirms the correct block of time with a "Fall" or "Tick".

## Drill 12: Tone Arm Assessment (Assessment by TA)
**Purpose**: To identify the item that produces the *most* charge (Total TA Action), rather than just an instant read.

**Reference**: See [Assessment Word Lists](manual/assessment_lists.md) (List 5) for practice material.

**Steps**:
1.  **Read** through a list of items (e.g., "Traffic, Money, Health").
2.  **Discuss** each item for 10-15 seconds.
3.  **Observe**: Watch how much the **TA moves overall** (how wide the waves are) for each item.
4.  **Compare**: The item that caused the most "Action" (widest waves, most frequent drops) is the "Major Item".

## Drill 13: Production of Reactions (Steering)
**Purpose**: To actively *produce* specific graph patterns by asking specific types of questions ("Steering").

**Theory**:
*   **Falls** come from release of charge (losses, disagreements, successful looking).
*   **Rises** come from resistance (problems, confusion, blocked looking).

**Steps**:
1.  **Produce a Fall**: Ask the subject to recall:
    *   "A time you lost something."
    *   "A disagreement you had."
    *   *Result*: Look for a smooth Drop.
2.  **Produce a Rise**: Ask the subject to recall:
    *   "A problem you couldn't solve."
    *   "A time you were confused."
    *   *Result*: Look for a climbing line (Rise).
3.  **Goal**: Learn the correlation between the **Client's Attention** and the **Graph**:
    *   **Fall** (Truth/Confront): Sudden viewing of a potentially charged incident.
    *   **Rise** (Resistance): Blocking or resisting the images (often follows a Fall).
    *   *Steering*: You guide them by noticing the Fall (Contact), then handling the subsequent Rise (Resistance).

## Drill 14: The "That!" Drill
**Purpose**: To validate a spontaneous read and create a feedback loop with the subject.

**Steps**:
1.  **Roam**: Ask the subject to "Think about the events of today."
2.  **Spot**: Watch the graph for a spontaneous Fall or Tick.
3.  **Tag**: The moment it happens, say **"That!"** or **"What was that?"**.
4.  **Identify**: Have the subject identify exactly what they were thinking at that split second.
5.  **Verify**: Ask them to think that *exact thought* again.
    *   *Result*: The read should reproduce exactly.
    *   *Lesson*: This proves that **Thought produces Mass/Energy**.

## Drill 15: Cleaning a Read
**Purpose**: To "Clean" a Dirty Needle by locating the hidden disagreement or protest causing it.

**Reference**: See [Assessment Word Lists](manual/assessment_lists.md) (List 7) for controversial statements.

**Theory**:
A "Dirty Needle" (ragged, ticking, or tight) is caused by a **held disagreement** or valid protest.

**Steps**:
1.  **Material**: Give the subject **List 7** to read *silently*.
2.  **Observe**: Watch for the **graph** becoming "Dirty" (ragged ticks) while they read a specific line.
3.  **Tag**: Immediately ask: *"What did you just read?"*
4.  **Locate**: Ask: *"What was the disagreement?"* / *"What about that statement do you object to?"*
5.  **Result**: As they voice the disagreement ("I love coffee!"), the **line** should **Clean** (smooth out).

## Drill 16: Rudiments Check (Session Setup)
**Purpose**: To determine if the client is "In Session" and ready to begin work.

**Reference**: See [Assessment Word Lists](manual/assessment_lists.md) (List 8).

**Theory**:
*   **No Read**: The channel is clear. (Example: "Are you tired?" -> Flat line -> Not tired).
*   **Read (Fall/Tick)**: There is charge/distraction. (Example: "Are you tired?" -> Fall -> Yes, tired).

**Steps**:
1.  **Check**: Ask the questions from **List 8** one by one.
2.  **Observe**:
    *   **Clean/Floating**: Good. Move to next.
    *   **Read**: Stop. Handle the distraction (e.g., "What is it?" -> "It's too cold" -> Fix AC).
3.  **Goal**: Achieving a "Clean Needle" on all setup questions means the client is **Ready** to run the session.

## Drill 17: Peripheral Observation (Graph Mastery)
**Purpose**: To monitor the graph using **Peripheral Vision** while maintaining eye contact with the client.

**Theory**:
In a real session, staring at the screen breaks the connection with the client. You must be able to "feel" the read while looking at the person.

**Steps**:
1.  **Setup**: Place the screen slightly to the side.
2.  **Focus**: Look directly at the Coach (or a note pad).
3.  **Action**: The Coach creates random reads (squeezes or thoughts).
4.  **Call**: You must call **"That!"** instantly when the line drops, *without looking directly at the graph*.
5.  **Goal**: Seamless session management where the technology does not distract from the human connection.

## Drill 18: Using Buttons (Finding Hidden Charge)
**Purpose**: To practice using "Buttons" to get a read on a subject that seems flat.

**Reference**: [Assessment Word Lists](manual/assessment_lists.md) (List 9).

**Steps**:
1.  **Setup**: Coach holds the sensor. Coach decides on a topic that is bothering them slightly but they are suppressing (e.g., "My Commute").
2.  **Check**: Auditor asks: *"Do you have a problem with your commute?"*
    *   *Result*: Coach acts stoic. Graph should be Flat or Tiny Tick.
3.  **Button**: Auditor asks: *"On your commute, has anything been **Suppressed**?"*
    *   *Action*: Coach simulates a reaction (or feels it).
    *   *Result*: The graph should **Fall**.
4.  **Confirm**: Auditor acknowledges: *"That!"*
5.  **Goal**: To learn that a "Flat" topic is not always empty; it might just need the right **Button**.
