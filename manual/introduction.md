# Emergent Knowledge GSR/HRM App (v40)
## Welcome to the Inner Lab 🧠✨

Welcome, Psychonaut! You have just initialized the **Emergent Knowledge Bio-Feedback System**. 

This application is your cockpit for navigating the subtle currents of your own physiology. By monitoring **GSR (Galvanic Skin Response)** and **HRM (Heart Rate Monitor)** data, we can visualize the invisible dance between your sympathetic (Fight/Flight) and parasympathetic (Rest/Digest) nervous systems.

### 🌟 Key Concepts

*   **TA (Tone Arm)**: The "Background Tension" of your nervous system. 
    *   ⬆️ **Rising**: Activation, gathering energy, or stress.
    *   ⬇️ **Falling**: Release, relaxation, or "letting go".
*   **HRV (Heart Rate Variability)**: The flexibility of your heart. higher is generally "better" (more resilient).
*   **The Bio-Grid**: Our unique map of your state!
    *   **Quadrant 1 (Top Right)**: 🛡️ Disconnect (Safe but Checked Out)
    *   **Quadrant 2 (Top Left)**: 🚧 Resistance (Stress + Avoidance)
    *   **Quadrant 3 (Bottom Left)**: 🌪️ Overwhelm (Stress + Confrontation)
    *   **Quadrant 4 (Bottom Right)**: 🌿 Integration (Flow + Connection)

### 🎮 Controls

*   **Spacebar**: Reset the GSR center point to your current level. Do this if the line drifts too far!
*   **Arrows UP/DOWN**: Fine-tune the center point manually.
*   **Arrows LEFT/RIGHT**: Adjust Sensitivity (Zoom).
*   **Record Button**: Start a session to log your data for deep analysis later.

### 🚀 Getting Started

1.  **Strap In**: Ensure your GSR electrodes are on your fingers and your Heart Strap is secure.
2.  **Calibrate**: Click "Calibrate" to run the 4-step wizard. This customizes the math to *your* body's current baseline.
3.  **Explore**: Watch the graph. Try to relax. Try to stress yourself out (math problems help!). See what happens.
4. **Train**: Follow the simple exercises to learn how to read the graph.
