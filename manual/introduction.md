# Emergent Knowledge GSR App (v43)
## Welcome to the Inner Lab 🧠✨

Welcome, explorer! You have just initialized the **Emergent Knowledge Bio-Feedback System**. 

This application is your cockpit for navigating the subtle currents of your own physiology. By monitoring **GSR (Galvanic Skin Response)** data, we can visualize the invisible changes in your nervous system.

### 🌟 Key Concepts

*   **TA (Tone Arm)**: The "Background Tension" of your nervous system. 
    *   ⬆️ **Rising**: Activation, gathering energy, or resistance.
    *   ⬇️ **Falling**: Release, relaxation, or "letting go".
*   **TA COUNTER**: A numerical measure of the total "Fall" motion (downward movement) accumulated during a session. It quantifies the total amount of tension released.

### 🎮 Controls

*   **Zoom Slider**: Adjust the **SPAN** (Sensitivity) of the graph (or use Arrows/Scroll).
    *   **SPAN**: The percentage of the total Tone Arm range currently visible on the graph. 
        *   A **High Span** (e.g., 80%) shows a wide view of the trace.
        *   A **Low Span** (e.g., 2%) provides extreme magnification for spotting subtle movements.
*   **Record Button**: Start a session to log your data.
*   **Viewer Button**: Open the Session Viewer to review recorded sessions.
*   **Calibrate Button**: Open the Calibration Wizard to adjust the math to *your* body's current baseline.

### 🚀 Getting Started

1.  **Connect**: Ensure your GSR electrodes are securely on your fingers.
2.  **Calibrate**: Click "Calibrate" to run the 4-step wizard. This customizes the math to *your* body's current baseline.
3.  **Explore**: Watch the graph. Try to relax. Try to stress yourself out (math problems help!). See what happens.
4. **Train**: Follow the simple exercises to learn how to read the graph.

### 📼 The Session Viewer
The **Session Viewer** is your post-session analysis lab. By clicking the "Viewer" button, you can load any previously recorded session to:
*   **Replay**: Watch the exact trace movement in real-time.
*   **Analyze**: Spot patterns and markers that were missed during the live session.
*   **Pattern Selection**: Select session patterns to highlight on the trace.
*   **Audio Sync**: Listen to synchronized audio recordings to correlate verbal stimulus with biofeedback results.

#### ⌨️ Viewer Shortcuts
*   **Spacebar**: Toggle Play / Pause.
*   **Left / Right Arrows**: Jump backward or forward by 5 seconds.
*   **Shift + Left / Right Arrows**: Jump to the **Previous / Next Pattern** marker.

### 🔴 The Recording Workflow
The system is designed to automate the administrative overhead of a session, allowing you to focus purely on the biofeedback.

1.  **Session Setup**: Clicking **Record** prompts you to enter session details (Student name, process, etc.). These are saved to a `notes.txt` file within the session folder.
2.  **Auto-Calibration**: Once notes are submitted, the system automatically triggers the **Calibration Wizard**.
3.  **Active Tracking**: After calibration, the session begins. The system automatically:
    *   Logs the Date and Start Time.
    *   Starts the **TA COUNTER** to track tension release.
    *   Captures high-frequency GSR data and synchronized audio.
4.  **Session Summary**: When you click **Stop**, the system finalizes the recording and appends a summary to `notes.txt`, including:
    *   Total Duration.
    *   Start/End TA levels.
    *   Total **TA Count** (Total tension released).
