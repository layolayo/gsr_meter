# Method One: Word Clearing

**Reference**: Based on *Hubbard Method One Co-Audit Course*.

## The Barrier to Study
The primary reason a person gives up on a study or becomes confused is the **Misunderstood Word**. Method One is a sophisticated action to locate and clear these words using the meter.

## Drill: Clearing Commands ("Do Birds Fly?")
**Purpose**: To teach the student how to "Clear" a command (make sure it is understood) before running it.

**Method**: Commands are always cleared **Backwards** (from the last word to the first).
*   *Why?* Clearing backwards prevents the student from guessing the meaning of a word based on the context of the sentence ("glossing"). They must define the word as a standalone symbol.

**The Drill**:
1.  **Coach**: Acts as the preclear.
2.  **Student**: "I am going to clear this command with you: 'Do birds fly?'"
3.  **Student**: "What does 'Fly' mean to you?" (Last word first).
    *   *Coach*: Defines it.
    *   *Student*: Acknowledges. Checks graph for "Read" (Fall/Tick).
4.  **Student**: "What does 'Birds' mean to you?"
    *   *Coach*: Defines it.
5.  **Student**: "What does 'Do' mean to you?"
6.  **Student**: "Now, what does the full command mean to you?" (Forwards).

## The Method One Process (Subject Clearing)
**Purpose**: To completely clear a subject (e.g., "Math", "History", "Physics") by locating and defining every term within it that blocks understanding.

**The Roles**:
*   **Coach**: Controls the meter and reads the list.
*   **Student**: The person studying the subject.

**Preparation (The List)**:
The Coach prepares a list of subjects the Student has studied or been involved with.
*   **Standard List**: Religion, Medicine, Physics, History, Math, Grammar, Biology, Art, Music.
*   **Life Subjects**: Jobs, Hobbies, Relationships, Sports.
*   **Current Study**: The specific textbook or course being done now.

**The Procedure**:

### Phase 1: Assessment (Finding the Subject)
1.  **Scan**: The Coach reads the list of subjects rapidly.
    *   *Coach*: "Math... History... Physics... Grammar..."
2.  **Read**: Watch for a **Fall** or **Tick** on a subject.
    *   *Meter*: **Read** on "Physics".
3.  **Indicate**: Stop and tell the Student.
    *   *Coach*: "Physics."

### Phase 2: Finding the Word
1.  **Ask**: "In the subject of Physics, what word has been misunderstood?"
    *   *Student*: "Vector." (Or looks for it).
2.  **Verify**: Check for a read on the word found.

### Phase 3: Clearing the Word
1.  **Definition**: Student looks it up and reads definition aloud.
2.  **Derivation**: Read the origin (Roots).
3.  **Sentences**: Student uses the word in sentences until conceptually understood.
4.  **Check**: Look for **Floating Wave** (Release).

### Phase 4: The Loop (Handling the Subject)
If clearing the word does not fully resolve the "heavy" feeling on the subject:
1.  **Earlier Word**:
    *   *Coach*: "Is there an **earlier word** in Physics you did not understand?"
    *   *Student*: "Force." -> Clear it.
2.  **Earlier-Similar Subject**:
    *   *Coach*: "Is there an **earlier-similar subject** to Physics?"
    *   *Student*: "Mechanics."
    *   *Coach*: "Is there a misunderstood word in Mechanics?"
    *   *Student*: "Lever." -> Clear it.

### Example Session (The Chain)
*   *Subject*: **Planes** (Reads).
*   *Word*: **Fuselage** (Cleared). Still no full release.
*   *Coach*: "Earlier word in Planes?"
*   *Student*: **Propeller** (Cleared). Still no full release.
*   *Coach*: "Earlier-similar subject to Planes?"
*   *Student*: **Kite-flying**.
*   *Coach*: "Word in Kite-flying?"
*   *Student*: **Wind**.
*   *Action*: Student defines "Wind". Realizes how air supports weight. **Major Release (Floating Wave)**.
*   *Result*: The subject of "Planes" is now cleared because the root confusion ("Wind") is gone.

**End Result**: A student who can study the subject freely without "fog" or confusion.
