# Training Processes

After mastering the drills, the student is ready to run formal **Processes**. These are structured sessions designed to produce a result in the client.

We utilize two primary balanced processes for training:
1.  **Positive Gain**: ARC Straightwire (Recovering Ability).
2.  **Negative Release**: Integrity Processing (Removing Blocks).

## 1. Positive Gain: ARC Straightwire
**Purpose**: To improve the client's ability to recall and handle the components of ARC (Affinity, Reality, Communication). It is a "Light" process used to get the client comfortable with the meter and recalling the past without diving into trauma.

### Theory
*   **ARC**: Understanding is composed of **A**ffinity (Liking), **R**eality (Agreement), and **C**ommunication (Exchange).
*   **Recall**: By recalling times these existed, we strengthen the client's ability to face life.

### The Commands
Run these commands in a loop, asking one, getting the answer, acknowledging, and checking the graph.

1.  **"Recall a communication."**
2.  **"Recall a communication you really felt."**
3.  **"Recall a time you felt affinity for someone."**
4.  **"Recall a time someone felt affinity for you."**
5.  **"Recall a moment of reality."**
6.  **"Recall a time you really learned something."** (Reality)
7.  **"Recall a time you knew something was true."**

### Procedure
1.  **Setup**: Do the **Rudiments Check** (Drill 16). Ensure the client is "Ready".
2.  **Command**: Give the command (e.g., *"Recall a communication"*).
3.  **Graph**: Watch for a **Fall** (Read) when they find the memory.
4.  **Answer**: Let them tell you about it briefly.
5.  **Acknowledgement**: Acknowledge them (*"Good"*, *"Thank you"*).
6.  **Next**: Give the next command.
7.  **End Phenomenon (EP)**: The process is complete when the client is smiling, happy, and has a **Floating Wave** (Drill 8) on the graph.

## 2. Negative Release: Integrity Processing (Confessions)
**Purpose**: To relieve the individual of the burden of hidden "bad" actions (Withholds) which cause them to withdraw from life.

> "A person is only as sick as their secrets."

### Theory

#### The Overt Act
An **Overt** is a harmful act (or omission) committed against oneself, others, or the environment.
*   *Example*: Stealing money, lying to a spouse, breaking a promise.

#### The Withhold
A **Withhold** is an Overt that the person is hiding or keeping secret.
*   **The Mechanism**: When a person hides an act, they generate electrical tension (mass) to keep it hidden. This tension registers on the meter as a **Dirty Needle** or **Stuck Needle**.

#### The Motivator
To justify the Overt, the person often invents a "Motivator" (a reason why the other person deserved it).
*   *Sequence*: You hit him (Overt) -> You say "He was looking at me funny" (Justification/Motivator).

### Pattern Recognition
*   **Instant Read**: The question hit the exact button.
*   **Dirty Needle**: The needle is agitated, ragged, or ticking. This indicates the person is **struggling** with a secret or a withholding.
*   **Clean Needle**: The needle flows smoothly (no ticks). This indicates the area is clean.

### Procedure: The Security Check
**Goal**: To clean the needle by finding and acknowledging the withholds.

#### Step 1: The Question
Ask a question from a prepared list (or "Security Check").
*   **Reference**: Use [Assessment Lists - List 10](manual/assessment_lists.md)
*   *Assistant*: "Have you ever stolen anything?"

#### Step 2: The Assessment
Watch the meter *instantly* as you ask.
*   **No Read (Clean)**: They say "No", and the needle is smooth. Move on.
*   **Dirty / Tick / Fall**: There is something there.

#### Step 3: Getting the "What"
If there is a read, you must get the **Full Overt**.
*   *Assistant*: "What was that?"
*   *Client*: "Well, I took a pen once."
*   *Assistant*: "When?"
*   *Client*: "Last year."
*   *Assistant*: "Where?"
*   *Client*: "At the office."
*   *Assistant*: "Who was involved?"
*   *Client*: "Just me."

#### Step 4: The Release
Once the *entirety* of the withhold is told (nothing left hidden), the tension dissipates.
*   **Look for**: A noticeable **Fall** followed by a **Floating Wave** or a **Clean Needle**.
*   *Assistant*: "Thank you."

### Handling "Missed Withholds"
If the needle becomes *extremely* violent or dirty, you may have "Missed" a withhold (gone past it without acknowledging it).
*   **Remedy**: Ask "What did we miss?" or "Is there something you almost said?"

### End Phenomenon
The process is complete when the person can look at the subject (e.g., "Stealing") with zero reaction on the meter (Clean Needle) and feels happy/relieved.
