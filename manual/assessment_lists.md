### List 9: Assessment Buttons (Drill 18 - "Hot Words")
**Concept**: A "Button" is a word that triggers a reaction in the mind. If a subject (e.g., "Your Job") is "Flat" (No Read), you add a button to find the hidden charge.

**The Big Three**:
1.  **Suppressed**: (Held down, squash, silenced).
2.  **Invalidated**: (Made wrong, mocked, diminished).
3.  **Evaluated**: (Told what to think, judged).

**Usage Example**:
*   *Coach*: "Do you have a problem with your boss?" -> (No Read).
*   *Coach*: "On your boss, has anything been **Suppressed**?" -> (**FALL**).

**The Expanded Buttons**:
*   Betrayed?
*   Wronged?
*   Mistaken?
*   Refused?
*   Falsified?
*   Hidden?

2.  "Have you lied to someone you shouldn't have?"
3.  "Have you damaged any property being used by others?"
4.  "Have you betrayed a trust?"
