# Training Drills

These practice drills are modernized versions of the original 1965 E-Meter drills, adapted for the GSR digital interface. They are designed to familiarize you with the controls and responsiveness of the system.

> "The drill is passed when the student auditor can do the drill rapidly and precisely without any flunks." - *The Book of E-Meter Drills*

## Drill 1: Interface Familiarization
**Purpose**: To familiarize the user with the digital controls.

**Commands**:
Perform the following actions in sequence until fluid:

### 1. Zoom (Sensitivity)
**Locate**: Zoom Controls (Arrows `LEFT`/`RIGHT` or Scroll Wheel).
**Action**:
1.  **Press** `RIGHT` to increase Zoom (Zoom In). The graph will move faster for small changes.
2.  **Press** `LEFT` to decrease Zoom (Zoom Out). The graph will smoothen out.
**Goal**: Understand that Zoom changes the *scale* of the graph, not the data itself.

### 2. Manual Navigation
**Action**:
1.  **Press** `UP` or `DOWN` arrows to fine-tune the trace position.
**Goal**: To practice manual control of the graph center.

### 3. Calibrate
**Locate**: The blue "Calibrate" button.
**Action**:
1.  **Click** "Calibrate".
2.  Follow the on-screen prompts (Squeeze, Relax, Breathe).
**Goal**: To normalize the sensor to your current skin resistance baseline.

### 4. Center Trace
**Locate**: The "Spacebar" or central "SET" area.
**Action**:
1.  Wait for the graph line to drift near the top or bottom.
2.  **Press** `Spacebar`.
**Result**: The graph line instantly re-centers to the middle of the screen.

### 5. TA COUNTER
**Locate**: The "TA Counter" panel (Bottom Left).
**Action**:
1.  **Click** "Start". The background turns Red (Active).
2.  **Watch** the value accumulate as the graph falls.
3.  **Click** "Stop". The background turns Green (Idle).
4.  **Click** "Reset" to zero the counter.

### 6. RECORD
**Locate**: The "Record" button.
**Action**:
1.  **Click** "Record". Note the red status text and recording timer.
2.  **Click** "Stop" to end the session recording.

## Drill 2: Production of TA Motion (Squeeze)
**Purpose**: To demonstrate the user's ability to affect the graph at will.

**Position**: Hand on the sensor / electrodes.

**Steps**:
1.  Ensure the graph is moving and steady.
2.  **Command**: "SQUEEZE"
    *   *Action*: Firmly squeeze the sensor.
    *   *Result*: Observe the TA Value **Drop** (Graph Line goes DOWN).
3.  **Command**: "RELAX"
    *   *Action*: Relax your hand completely.
    *   *Result*: Observe the TA Value **Rise** (Graph Line goes UP) and recover.

**Goal**: Reproduce a "Fall" pattern on command.

## Drill 3: Instant Reads (Clean vs Dirty)
**Purpose**: To distinguish between a valid bio-response and a body-motion artifact.

**Steps**:
1.  Sit perfectly still.
2.  **Think** of a minor annoyance (e.g., "Traffic").
    *   Observe the **Instant Read** (Sharp Drop). This is a "Clean" read.
3.  **Wiggle** your finger or shift in your chair.
    *   Observe the "Squirm" or "Motion" pattern. Note how the line looks "jagged" or "dirty" compared to the smooth bio-response.

> "A dirty **graph** is a **graph** that acts ragged... A clean **graph** acts smooth."

## Drill 3a: The Pinch Test (First Interaction)
**Purpose**: To prove that the meter registers physical pain and to conduct the first "Auditor -> Preclear" interaction.

**Position**:
*   **Coach**: Holds the electrodes.
*   **Student**: Controls the meter and gives commands.

**Steps**:
1.  **Command**: Student says *"Squeeze the cans."*
2.  **Action**:
    *   Student reaches over and gives the Coach a sharp **Pinch** on the arm (or Coach simulates sudden pain).
    *   Coach reacts physically to the pinch.
3.  **Observe**:
    *   The graph should **Fall** (Drop) instantly at the moment of the pinch.
4.  **Goal**: To realize that the graph is connected to the person's reality. A stimulus *here* causes a reaction *there*.

## Drill 4: Handling the Tone Arm (Graph Tracking)
**Purpose**: To train the user to keep the reading centered without distracting focus.

**Concept**:
In the analog days, the "Tone Arm" had to be moved constantly to keep the needle on the dial. In this digital app, the **Auto-Center** feature handles this mostly, but manual intervention is sometimes needed.

**Steps**:
1.  **Observe** the graph drifting towards the top or bottom edge.
2.  **Practice** tapping the `Spacebar` to bring the line back to the middle.
3.  **Goal**: Maintain a continuous view of the trace without letting it hit the "roof" or "floor".

---

## Drill 5: Assessment (Calling Reads)
**Purpose**: To practice identifying and calling reads in real-time.

**Reference**: See [Assessment Word Lists](manual/assessment_lists.md) for practice material.

**Steps**:
1.  The Coach (or you, out loud) reads a list of items (e.g., "Apples, Oranges, Pears").
2.  **Watch the Graph** precisely as each word is spoken.
3.  **Call** "Fall", "Rise", or "Tick" immediately upon seeing the pattern.
4.  **Note Latency**: The reaction should be *instant*. If it happens 1 second later, it is a "Latent Read".

> "The student must classify the read exactly as it happens."

## Drill 6: Body Motion vs. Mental Shift
**Purpose**: To differentiate between valid "Reads" and false "Body Motion".

**Concept**:
Physical movement causes interference. The GSR Meter app has a built-in **Motion Detector** (Anti-Squirm) that will lock the sensitivity if it detects rapid, erratic changes.

**Steps**:
1.  **Create Body Motion**: Yawn, stretch, or wiggle your fingers while holding the sensor.
    *   *Result*: Observe the graph becoming "jagged" or red "MOTION" text appearing.
2.  **Create Mental Motion**: Sit still and think of a stressful topic.
    *   *Result*: Observe the smooth "Fall" or "Rise".
3.  **Goal**: Learn to trust *smooth* lines and discard *jagged* ones.

## Drill 7: Spotting Blowdowns
**Purpose**: To identify major release points ("Blowdowns").

**Definition**:
A **Blowdown** is a sudden, rapid drop of **> 2.0 Units/sec**. It indicates a major release of resistance/charge.

**Steps**:
1.  **Preparation**: Sit comfortably. Ensure the graph is steady.
2.  **Create Tension**: Tense your arm or chest muscles slightly (Rise).
3.  **Sudden Release**: Abruptly let go of all tension with a heavy deep breath or "sigh".
    *   *Action*: Imagine dropping a heavy weight.
    *   *Result*: The line should plummet vertically (faster than a Fall).
4.  **Observation**: Watch for the **Green** "BLOWDOWN" text indicator or the distinct vertical drop.

---

## Drill 8: The "Floating Wave" (Positive Indicator)
**Purpose**: To identify a state of "Flow" or "Release".

**Definition**:
A **Floating Wave** is a rhythmic, sine-wave like motion where the line rises and falls gently without external commands. It indicates the subject is "in session" and processing.

**Steps**:
1.  **Preparation**: Sit comfortably and relax.
2.  **Observe**: Watch the graph for 10-20 seconds without doing anything.
3.  **Goal**: Identify the "Rhythm".
    *   *Good Sign*: The line moves up and down gently on its own.
    *   *Bad Sign*: The line is dead flat (No reaction at all).
