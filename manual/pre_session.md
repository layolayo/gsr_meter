# The Outer Gates: Havingness & Confront

In the vast expanse of human consciousness, where the depths of memory and the essence of self await discovery, we must first stand firm at the threshold of the present. Imagine the Outer Gates as portals guarding the path to deeper truths. Here, we prepare the **Student**—not merely to explore, but to *truly inhabit* the world around them. 

Through the rituals of **Havingness** and **Confront**, we forge the presence and perception required to navigate the high-speed data of the session.

## Section 1: Objective Havingness (Expanding Awareness)

**Purpose**: This process is the primary remedy for a "stuck" or "dead" GSR meter response, or a high Tone Arm (high tension). 

### The Theory of Mass
In several cases, a "stuck" or "dead" trace occurs because the student is subconsciously "pulling in" mental mass rather than releasing it. This makes the response feel stiff or unresponsive.

### The Goal
The goal of Havingness is to make the trace **"loose" and "alive"** again by making the student acknowledge the physical world around them. 

### Application Logic
Guides should trigger this process when:
*   The Zoom Level (Sensitivity) has to be cranked up too high to see any movement.
*   The trace stops moving entirely during a session (introversion).
*   The Tone Arm remains stuck in a high-tension position.

### The Delivery Mechanics
To achieve the best results, the **Guide** must follow a strict cycle:
1.  **Command**: The Guide gives the command (e.g., *"Look around here and find something you can have"*).
2.  **Observation**: The Guide confirms the Student has looked at the object.
3.  **Acknowledgment**: The Guide acknowledge the Student's realization or action.

### GSR Meter Checks & End Phenomenon (EP)
*   **The Starting State**: The trace is likely tight, sticky, or has a "stiff" motion.
*   **The Process Action**: As the student identifies objects, the trace should begin to **"loosen up."** Look for a clear **Fall** indicating the tension of "not having" has released.
*   **End Phenomenon (EP)**: Run this until you reach a **Floating Wave**. This indicates the student has "filled up" on havingness and is no longer introverted.

### Process Options
Choose one of the following and run it until the student feels bright and the meter response is stable/floating.

#### Option A: Simple Ownership
Command: **"Look around here and find something you could have."**
*   *Procedure*: Guide asks, student points or names, Guide acknowledges. Repeat.

#### Option B: Reality Anchor
Command: **"Look around here and find something you can agree with."**
*   *Purpose*: To establish a shared reality between the student and the physical space, grounding them through agreement.

#### Option C: Dynamic Connection
Command: **"Notice that [Object]. Get the idea of making it connect with you."**
*   *Procedure*: Guide picks a specific object (lamp, chair, etc.)

#### Option D: Effect Prevention
Command: **"Look around here and point out an effect you could prevent."**
*   *Purpose*: To restore a sense of agency and power over the environment.

## Section 2: Confrontingness (Facing What Is)

**Purpose**: The goal is to rehabilitate the student's ability to simply *be* in a place and perceive what is there without avoidance or "blink." While Havingness handles "Mass," Confront handles **Ability and Willingness**.

### The Theory of Emotional Charge
Avoidance creates mental "mass" and emotional charge, which directly manifests as a "Rise" on the graph. When a student can comfortably confront a subject, they discharge this tension. 

### GSR Meter Checks & End Phenomenon (EP)
*   **The Question Read**: Watch for an **Instant Fall** the moment a difficult subject is named (e.g., "What would you rather not confront?").
*   **The Discharge**: As the student discusses the topic, the trace might show small **Ticks** or **Dirty Responses**. These are positive signs of "blowing off charge."
*   **End Phenomenon (EP)**: This process is complete when the student has a major **Cognition** (realization) accompanied by a wide **Floating Wave**.

### Process Options
Choose one of the following based on the student's current state.

#### Option A: Basic Confront
Command: **"What could you confront?"**
Followed by: **"What would you rather not confront?"**
*   *EP*: Major Cognition + Floating Wave.

#### Option B: Presenting the Unconfrontable
Command: **"What unconfrontable thing could you present?"**
*   *Purpose*: Helps the student move from "hiding" to "showing," which cleans the response.

#### Option C: External Perception
Command: **"Tell me something I am not doing to you."**
*   *Purpose*: To break the "attention loop" of a student who is too focused on the Guide's perceived judgments.

#### Option D: Existence & Understanding
Command: **"What is understandable?"**
Followed by: **"What is understanding?"**
*   *Purpose*: To restore the student's confidence in their own analytical ability.

### Procedure Note for Guides
Always start a session with a few rounds of **Havingness** if the student seems distracted or "heavy." Switch to **Confront** if the student seems to be dodging questions or avoiding eye contact. 

The session is ready to move to "Core Processes" once the meter shows a **Floating Wave** or a consistently **Clean Response**.

## Technical Appendix: The Three Degrees of Intent

For advanced students, we can explore the **Inner Web**—where intentions weave the threads of our connection to others. This process untangles "missed" connections or heavy regrets by exploring the three layers of intent.

### Degree 1: The Spark of Possibility
*Exploring potential interaction.*
Command: **"Get the idea of doing something to [Name]."**
Followed by: **"Get the idea of withholding something from [Name]."**
*   **GSR Goal**: Look for small **Ticks** or **Fires**. These indicate where the student is "playing" with a creative or restrictive thought.

### Degree 2: The Action of Now
*Confronting current interaction.*
Command: **"What have you done to [Name]?"**
Followed by: **"What have you withheld from [Name]?"**
*   **GSR Goal**: Look for a **Fall** when a truth is named. A **Dirty Response** here indicates a hidden withhold that needs to be explored.

### Degree 3: The Echo of Reflection
*Processing the past (Clearing Regret).*
Command: **"Get the idea of having done something to [Name]."**
Followed by: **"Get the idea of having withheld something from [Name]."**
*   **GSR Goal**: This degree "runs regret." Look for a heavy **Long Fall** as the relief of past tension is released. The process is complete when the student feels a sense of peace regarding [Name].
