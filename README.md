# gsr_meter
Linux app to record psychotherapy session using GSR, EEG and HRM

EEG Meter is the BrainCo device also known as FocusCalm

GSR Meter is the Russian made Theta-Meter, used predominantly by ex-$cientologists

HRM Meter is the Garmin HRM-Run an ANT+ device

App shows the fluctuating GSR and trending EEG, the HRM grid maps changes in HR vs HRV (still a work in progress)

Hope to use this to analyse biofeedback data as clients are run on EK based therapy/coaching sessions and then look for correlations between these three types of data.

From v37 - EEG was removed to attempt elimination of graph stuttering, also gathered data showed no valid correlation to clients psychological state
