# gsr_meter
Linux app to record psychotherapy session using GSR USB Adapter

GSR Meter is the Russian made Theta-Meter, used predominantly by ex-$cientologists

App shows the fluctuating GSR and records everything in real-time with audio for playback

Hope to use this to analyse biofeedback data as clients are run on EK based therapy/coaching sessions
